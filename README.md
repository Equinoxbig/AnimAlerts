# AnimAlerts

A chrome addon that notifies you when a new episode or scan is released.

## Getting Started

Download the project as zip and load it as non-zipped extension from : (don't forget to set dev mode on)
```
chrome://extensions
```

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by doing a Pull Request at anytime or opening an issue if you find one.

If you want to help translating just create a new folder named as the [language's  code](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/i18n?csw=1#localeTable) then copy paste [messages.json](https://github.com/Equinoxbig/AnimAlerts/blob/master/_locales/en/messages.json) into it and start translating the messages.

If you want to change the icon just make a normal PR.

If you want to port the extension to another browser and use the same layout, websocket, API and name make a github repo and link it to me, I would gladly help you.
